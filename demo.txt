Customer Support Refund Policy

Describe the source content:

I am building a chatbot to answer customer support refund quesitons. This document contains the policy to apply. Here's a sample Q&A:
- Question: I bought a laptop for $1000 two weeks ago. Can I get a refund if I return it today?
- Answer: Yes.

Plan:
1. Create AR policy in the console. Show the existing one, tests, ...
2. Create Guardrails and use the AR policy.
3. Show JSON test cases.
4. Run static.
5. Run bedrock (guardrials in the invocation).
6. Run OpenAI with apply guardrails.
7. Run Strands Agents with hook + apply guardrails (comapre to BedrockModel guardrails).
8. Export AR policy (show raw JSON, CFN YAML + JSON).
