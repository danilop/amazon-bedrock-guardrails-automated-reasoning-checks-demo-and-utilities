Customer Support Refund Policy

Describe the source content:

I am building a chatbot to answer customer support refund quesitons. This document contains the policy to apply. Here's a sample Q&A:
- Question: I bought a laptop for $1000 two weeks ago. Can I get a refund if I return it today?
- Answer: Yes.

Plan:
1. Create AR policy in the console. Show the existing one, tests, ...
2. Create Guardrails and use the AR policy.
3. Show JSON test cases.
4. Show code for static demo. Show apply_guardrail. Run it.
5. Show code for Bedrock demo. Show guardrails in converse API (guardrials in the invocation). Run it.
6. Show code for OpenAI demo. Show .env.example and use of OpenAI SDK. Show apply_guardrail. Run it.
7. Show code for Strands Agents demo. Show hook + apply_guardrail (compare to BedrockModel guardrail config).
8. Export AR policy (show raw JSON, CFN YAML + JSON).
